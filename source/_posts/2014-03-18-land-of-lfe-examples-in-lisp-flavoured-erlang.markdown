During the past 2 months I've been using [LFE](http://lfe.github.io) for a project at work. I don't find Erlang syntax to be overly complex, but the Lisp-Flavouring makes it more compelling. I've also been wanting to read [Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/) and this seems like a good time to do it. I'm taking this opportunity to implement the examples in LFE.

You can find the code at [jschairb/land-of-lfe](https://github.com/jschairb/land-of-lfe).
